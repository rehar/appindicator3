# appindicator3-rs
[![LGPL-2.1 licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](./LICENSE)
Rust bindings for the AppIndicator and AyatanaAppIndicator library.

##  [Ayatana](https://ayatanaindicators.github.io/) Application Indicator Library

Allows applications to export a menu into the an Application
Indicators aware menu bar. Based on KSNI it also works in KDE and will
fallback to generic Systray support if none of those are available.

## Usage

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
appindicator3 = "0.1.0"
```

By default `appindicator3-rs` links against the libayatana-appindicator3 library. To link against the original libappindicator3 library enable the original feature:

```toml
[dependencies]
appindicator3 = {version = "0.1.0", feature = [“original”, “v0_5”]}

```

### Example Program

```rust
use appindicator3::{prelude::*, IndicatorStatus};
use appindicator3::{Indicator, IndicatorCategory};
use gtk::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    gtk::init().unwrap();

    let m = gtk::Menu::new();
    let mi = gtk::MenuItem::with_label("Hello World");
    mi.connect_activate(|_| {
        gtk::main_quit();
    });
    m.add(&mi);
    mi.show_all();

    let _indicator = Indicator::builder("Example")
        .category(IndicatorCategory::ApplicationStatus)
        .menu(&m)
        .icon("face-smile", "icon")
        .status(IndicatorStatus::Active)
        .build();

    gtk::main();
}
```

Additonal examples can be found in [examples](./examples).

## Bindings

A large portion of the bindings is auto generated by GObject Introspection and [gir](gir/) using [this](Gir.toml) configuration file.
